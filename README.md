# Team-Profile-Generator

This application is intended to help individuals quikly make a profile webpage for their company that is professional and simple in design.

## Overview

This repository takes in user input from pre-defined questions and creates a simple team profile html document. They will be able to display contact information in a centralized location.

A challenge I faced when creating this repository was working with classes and sub-classes in JavaScript. Best designing the code to interact between classes and files took many attempts and hours of research. For future improvements, I would like to provide more position options, as currently there are only three options.


## Installation

To install this repository for use, you will need to download all files in the [Team-Profile-Generator](https://github.com/glchavez/Team-Profile-Generator) repository.

Please note, you will need node.js to run this repository on your computer.


## Usage

To create a team profile html document, you will need to open the index.js document. In the integrated terminal of index.js, enter "node index.js". This will start the list of questions that asks the user what they would like to be included for position of the team profile. Once all of the questions have been answered and "None" is selected when prompted for an additional employee, a html document will be created in the dist folder of the repository. You can then move the html document to the desired folder on your computer.

The created team profile webpage will look as such:
